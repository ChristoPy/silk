# About and motivation
Silk is a programming language that was designed to reduce programming errors caused by the inherent flexibility and power of JavaScript. Although JavaScript is an incredibly powerful language that allows developers to do almost anything, its flexibility can sometimes lead to unexpected results and errors.

While TypeScript can help to reduce errors, Silk is not meant to replace JavaScript or TypeScript. TypeScript is primarily known for its type system, linting, and tooling capabilities, but it is also incredibly powerful in other ways, thanks to its compiler.

Silk takes a different approach from TypeScript. It encourages developers to write functional code while still taking advantage of the full power of JavaScript. If TypeScript were used instead, it could become overwhelming quickly, as TypeScript grows in the same way as JavaScript does.

It's worth noting that Silk is currently a small subset of JavaScript, designed to provide developers with a more focused and streamlined approach to coding in JavaScript.
